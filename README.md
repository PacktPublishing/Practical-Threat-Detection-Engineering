## Get to Know the Authors
**Megan Roddie**
is an experienced information security professional with a diverse background ranging from incident response to threat intelligence to her current role as a detection engineer. Additionally, Megan is a course author and instructor with the SANS Institute where she regularly publishes research on cloud incident response and forensics. Outside of the cyber security industry, Megan trains and competes as a high-level amateur Muay Thai fighter in Austin, TX.

**Jason Deyalsingh**
is an experienced consultant with over nine years of experience in the cyber security space. He has spent the last 5 years focused on digital forensics and incident response (DFIR). His current hobbies include playing with data and failing to learn Rust.

**Gary J. Katz**
is still trying to figure out what to do with his life while contemplating what its purpose really is. While not spiraling into this metaphysical black hole compounded by the plagues and insanity of this world, he sometimes thinks about cyber security problems and writes them down. These ruminations are, on occasion, captured in articles and books.
